You can request for extra spice in all the dishes served here. Excellent tandoori starters. Over all satisfied in every aspect. Food, atmosphere and the service.

The staff were generous enough to get us a complementary dessert for no reason other than the fact that we had to wait some 20 mins for a table, through no fault of theirs.\n\nHeartily recommended to anyone looking for high quality Italian food.
