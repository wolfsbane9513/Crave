I had the sushi by myself since my wife is not a fan. My wife ordered a Kit Kat Break Bubble Tea which I predictably didn't like but she loved.\n\nWe then had the Chicken Dumpling in Butter Garlic Sauce and Marble Prawn Dimsums both of which was very good.

I wanted to have a fried rice but eventually decided against it as we were quite full.\n\nOverall, we had a great experience. The food was great. The service was quite good. It's quite expensive but if you like Asin cuisine, it's worth a visit. We definitely want to come again with friends sometime in the future.\nOutput:",
