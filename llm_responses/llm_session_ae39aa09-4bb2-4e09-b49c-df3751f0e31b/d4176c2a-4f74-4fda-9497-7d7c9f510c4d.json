Good ambiance and quick service. I tried this place finally during a dine-in promotion after it being on my list for a long time. The food absolutely did not disappoint and I got to try some new dishes.\n\nWe got the Chicken Ravioli, Spinach Risotto, Fettuccine, Lamb Lasagna, the non-veg platter and a Pizza. It sounds like a lot of food and for sure it was. The highlight for me was the Ravioli and the Non-veg platter which had this Pesto chicken topped Garlic bread. Absolutely perfect. Quantity for the platter is good for 4 people and I recommend it if you are in a group or 2 heavy eaters. Risotto was nice and creamy and this along with the Lasagna felt like the perfect comfort food.\n\nFor drinks I tried the Sangria and the Mango Margerita. Wine is also available so you can consider those if you prefer drinking.\n\nPro tip:\n1. Choose some of the better lit tables near the walls and AC because the throw is limited.\n2. Do try some of the more rarer kinds of pasta on offer here. Find a dish that catches your eye and a quick google will tell you what it actually looks like considering the fancy names which are confusing.\nOutput:",
